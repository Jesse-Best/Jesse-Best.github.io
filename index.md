## About

I am a geology student with experience in gold processing operations and a background in software engineering, working primarily with Python and QGIS.

My work focuses on task automation and geospatial data processing, with an emphasis on clean system design and intuitive interfaces.

Current projects include QGIS plugin development and game development using Godot.

## Current Projects
![WA Geo Data icon](/assets/image/wageodata_icon_32.png) **WA Geo Data** – A QGIS plugin providing direct access to publicly available map services published by the Western Australian Department of Mines, Petroleum and Exploration.

The plugin offers a simple, intuitive interface for discovering and loading geospatial datasets, geology series maps, and related resources available from the [Data WA](https://www.data.wa.gov.au/) website.

The plugin's github repository can be found at [WA Geo Data](https://github.com/Jesse-Best/WAGeoData).
